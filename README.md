# Networking Projects

## üåê Welcome to the Networking Projects Repository! üåê

This repository is a comprehensive resource for hands-on networking projects, catering to both traditional network engineers and those exploring the cutting edge of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Whether you're designing your first subnet, configuring routing protocols, or diving into network automation, you'll find valuable content here.

### üéØ The Goal

The primary goal is to provide practical, step-by-step guides and configurations to help you understand, design, implement, and troubleshoot various networking solutions. I believe in learning by doing, offering projects that range from fundamental concepts to advanced network architectures.

### ‚ú® What You'll Find Here

*   **Traditional Networking:**
    *   **Network Design & Topologies:** Projects on LAN/WAN design, subnetting, and network diagrams.
    *   **Routing & Switching:** Guides for configuring OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, VLANs, Spanning Tree, etc.
    *   **Network Services:** DHCP, DNS, NAT, VPN implementations.
    *   **Security:** Basic firewall rules, access control lists (ACLs).
*   **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) & Automation:**
    *   **SDN Controllers:** Projects using open source: OpenDaylight, ONOS, and POX or commercial Cisco APIC and Vmware NSX
    *   **Network Virtualization:** Deploying virtual networks.
    *   **Automation:** Scripts and playbooks using Ansible, Python (Netmiko, NAPALM), or similar tools.
*   **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting:**
    *   Tools and techniques for analyzing network traffic and diagnosing issues.
*   **Home Lab Setups:** Instructions for building your own networking lab with virtual machines or physical devices.

### üöÄ Getting Started

Each project or guide will reside in its own dedicated directory and include a detailed `README.md` explaining:

1.  **Project Goal:** What you will learn or build.
2.  **Prerequisites:** Necessary hardware/software, tools, or prior knowledge.
3.  **Architecture/Topology:** Diagrams and design considerations.
4.  **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Clear, actionable steps for implementation.
5.  **Verification:** How to confirm successful completion and troubleshoot common issues.
6.  **Further Exploration:** Ideas for expanding on the project.
